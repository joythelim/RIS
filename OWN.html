    <p>Index Universal Insurance is all in one product to build a proper Financial Foundation. It is permanent life insurance with cash value account and living benefits (critical, chronical, terminal illness). The cash value accumulation is credited by market performance with principal guaranteed. This secured money growth advantage will make X-curve that is offset of your debt. Tax free of death benefit, tax deferred on cash accumulation, income tax free on withdrawal while maintaining a death benefit. (if you maintain it well, the tax saving on capital gain could be bigger than the insurance cost.)</p>

    <h2>Flexibility on long term.</h2>
    <p>If your seed money is big then 1M -> 7% X 1 Year = $ 70,000
    What if your seed money is $100/month then you need more time to beat 1M.
    $100/month -> 7% X 23 Years = $74,300</p>
    <p>Long term investment is our fatality. During the time, you need flexibility on the changes of life.
    Therefore the adjustable account is not a choice and easy access while your money grow for long run.</p>

    <h2>Protection.</h2>
    <p>Protection of financial loss of death and dysfunctions of living. Immediate tax free asset creation. Of course there is cost of insurance. It is not inexpensive but if you understand IUL well and maintain it as you understand then your tax saving can be bigger then what you pay for the protection. And the capital gain will pay for what you need to pay to keep the protections in life time.</p>
